TimelyTextView
==============

Animated TextView like Timely app


v1 : 
Thanks to Malinskiy, the project now has Gradle/Maven support !  Few things that have been fixed as well :

- The layout_height & layout_width parameters are now supported. 
- Animate between any two numbers(no need for consecutive numbers, any longer)
- Sample demo available in the repository 

Again a huge thanks to Malinskiy(https://github.com/Malinskiy) for the effort !

v0 :
Intital commit for Animated TextView present in the Timely(Alarm) App.


This is just an addition to the concept explained by Sriram Ramani here : http://sriramramani.wordpress.com/2013/10/14/number-tweening/

I have just figured out missing bits & pieces and made a simple library out of it. Please thank Sriram if this helped you. Also please note I have been very busy and this was the outcome  of just 2hrs of work on a lazy Monday afternoon, so there might be a few bugs. It would be great if anyone else wants to contribute and take this to the next level. Have a few ideas in mind already, feel free to get in touch and send Pull Requests.


Usage :

XML Layout:
``` xml
<com.github.adnansm.timelytextview.TimelyView
       android:id="@+id/textView1"
       android:layout_width="wrap_content"
       android:layout_height="40dp"
       android:layout_gravity="center"
       android:layout_margin="@dimen/activity_vertical_margin"
       />
```

Java:
``` java
    public class MainActivity extends Activity {
    private TimelyView timelyView; 
              @Override
              protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
                    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
                    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
                    timelyView = (TimelyView) findViewById(R.id.textView1);
              }
   }
```
